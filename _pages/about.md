<i>"My heart in my work" - Andrew Carnegie</i>

Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17GwpDJFucQoMlLc91AxcsP38_2nrAYEd/view?usp=share_link)

Hello there! My name is Mukul Ganwal, and I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. I have a passion for robotics and artificial intelligence and have taken courses such as Robot Dynamics and Analysis, ML & AI for Engineers, Modern Control Theory, and Trustworthy AI Autonomy, among others.

I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering at Vellore Institute of Technology, where I gained relevant coursework experience in Robotics, Product Development and Management, and Computer-Aided Design/Computer-Aided.

In terms of professional experience, I have had the opportunity to work with PGP Glass Private Ltd and Maruti Suzuki India Ltd as a Data Science Intern, where I developed a PySpark preprocessing pipeline, analyzed the automation of quality control, and built a database to identify the best location for electric vehicle charging. Additionally, I completed a Summer Internship with Hero Moto Corp Ltd, where I proposed a new packaging label design.

I have also participated in several projects during my academic career. One of my most notable projects is the Landing Site Evaluator project at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked with a team of four students to devise an algorithm to automate landing site evaluation based on mesh grid input of lunar surface. As a team lead of four, I also created a CAD design and prototype of a quadruped walking robot with 6 DOF and developed a three-wheeled sanitation robot equipped with prismatic joint arms utilizing UV light for sanitation and ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection.

Aside from my academic and professional pursuits, I have also ranked 63rd nationally in Hero Campus Challenge 6, cleared the first stage of the International Physics Olympiad in 2018, and ranked 7th in the State level Chess open category conducted by the Government of Gujarat.

In terms of skills, I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, MATLAB, C, and C++, and machine learning tools such as PyBullet, Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit. I am also skilled in tools and technologies such as SolidWorks, ANSYS, Fusion360, Catia, IBM Cp4d, GCP, Git, V-Rep, and Webots.

Thank you for taking the time to read my about me page, and I look forward to any potential opportunities that may come my way!
