Hi, I'm **Mukul Ganwal** - a passionate roboticist driven by my love for robots and their potential to transform our world. 

Here's my [Curriculum Vitae](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tAPE86ZtibBmbd4i2_nG6GHSmxvyKsb3/view?usp=sharing) for detailed information.

I am a Perception and MLOps Engineer at Anyware Robotics, where I lead a 4-person team developing end-to-end robotic palletizing systems that integrate computer vision with industrial automation. My work focuses on building production-grade machine learning pipelines that enable robots to understand and interact with complex real-world environments. Currently, I'm shipping systems that use RGB-D cameras and advanced perception algorithms to reconstruct work cells in 0.1 seconds, allowing FANUC robots to palletize boxes with 6.3-second cycle times.

My expertise lies at the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and MLOps. I specialize in creating active-learning workflows that dramatically reduce data labeling requirements - achieving 40% reductions in manual annotation while maintaining rapid 40-minute test-to-deploy cycles. I've pioneered the use of synthetic data generation through Blender photogrammetry combined with StyleGAN3 domain randomization, scaling datasets by 8Ã— and improving detection performance by 4.7 percentage points. My systems integrate seamlessly with ROS 2 architectures, incorporating behavior trees and hierarchical finite-state machines with real-time fault classification that has reduced unplanned robot downtime by 35%.

Before joining Anyware Robotics, I honed my skills as a Graduate Research Assistant at the BioRobotics Lab in Pennsylvania, where I engineered modular battery extraction mechanisms for Apple devices and built real-time multi-class instance segmentation pipelines achieving 98% accuracy. My journey into robotics and AI began with internships at PGP Glass and other companies, where I developed visual inspection systems with 99% defect detection accuracy and created intelligence systems that transformed business operations.

My technical toolkit spans **PyTorch, TensorFlow, Ray, Keras, JAX, CUDA, and ROS/ROS2** for ML and robotics, complemented by **Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Terraform, AWS, and GCP** for robust MLOps deployments. I'm proficient in **Python, C/C++, MATLAB, and Bash** across **Ubuntu, Debian, and FreeRTOS** environments, with expertise in simulation platforms like **Webots, Gazebo, and V-Rep** alongside CAD tools like **SolidWorks**.

What drives me is the belief that robots can fundamentally improve how we work and live. Every system I build bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI research and practical robotic applications that deliver measurable impact in real manufacturing environments.
