  - [E-Waste Management](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2021/july/device-recycling.html)
    - Creating Automated System Policy for component removal using a UR3 arm using computer vision for creating a closed loop control system.
    - Designing multiple system for various stages of recycling and retreving rare earth materials from different components.
    - Developed a robust data pipeline for the automated generation of hyper-realistic images using Blender, specifically designed for enhancing the adaptability of machine learning models. Created synthetic data with variations including broken glass, stickers, and other deformations to simulate real-world scenarios.
