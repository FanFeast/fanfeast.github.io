* <b>Tech Stack:</b> Python(PyBullet), ROS, SolidWorks
* <b> Summary </b>
    -  Created a CAD design and prototype of a quadruped walking robot and implemented yaw, pitch and roll as a team lead of four students; implemented trot, canter and pace gait to analyses the various performance
    -  Redesigned the legs of the quadruped robot making it capable of performing backflips; conducted kinematic workspace analysis of the robot and using the kinematic equation of motions and Simulink
