* <b>Tech Stack:Python, GitHub, AWS, GCP</b> 
* <b> Summary </b>
  * Design and build a legged robot that uses springs as a substitute for tendons to store kinetic energy, and develop a control system that can effectively exploit the elastic energy stored in the springs.
  *  Conduct experiments to evaluate the energy efficiency and dynamic performance of the legged robot with different spring configurations, and compare the results with those of a normal two-link leg design, with the goal of providing insights into the design and control of spring-leg systems for more energy-efficient and dynamic legged robots.

  * <p style="text-align: justify;">The use of robots in the biological field has shown tremendous potential in revolutionizing research and discovery. Robotic systems inspired by nature have been developed to mimic animal behavior and provide solutions to various challenges faced by the robotics community. The design and development of legged robots have been a subject of interest for researchers due to their potential to perform various tasks, including exploration, search and rescue, and military applications. However, the design of legged robots is still challenging, and optimizing their energy efficiency and dynamic motion remains a significant issue.</p>

  * <p style="text-align: justify;">In response to these challenges, our project aims to contribute to the growing field of biological-inspired robotics by exploring the significance of utilizing the inspiration derived from nature to solve a critical problem in legged robotics. Our focus is on the design of legged robots with the potential to recover energy. We aim to investigate the hypothesis that incorporating springs into the leg design of legged robots can allow for jumping with less energy. To achieve this goal, we will design and build a legged robot that uses springs as a substitute for tendons to store kinetic energy. Additionally, we will develop a control system that can effectively exploit the elastic energy stored in the springs.</p>
  * <p style="text-align: justify;">Our project aims to fill the gap in the literature by exploring the optimal design and configuration of springs for the legged robot, developing a control system that can effectively utilize the elastic energy stored in the springs, and evaluating the energy efficiency and dynamic performance of the legged robot. By providing insights into the design and control of spring-leg systems, our project's purpose is to contribute to the development of more energy-efficient and dynamic legged robots. Ultimately, our project will add to the existing knowledge and understanding of the potential of biological-inspired robotics and their applications in various fields.</p>
